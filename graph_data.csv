This pivotal scene reveals Ganga struggle with split personality disorder, where she oscillates between her own identity and that of Nagavalli. In a strategic plan crafted by Dr. Sunny, a psychiatrist, and executed with the help of Brahmadathan Namboothiripad, a tantric expert, Ganga is led to believe she is fulfilling Nagavalli revenge by beheading Nakulan, her husband, who is disguised as the Karanavar - the original target of Nagavalli wrath.
